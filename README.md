# Suiiii

A powerful web-based development environment for building, testing, and deploying Sui agentic workflows. 

This project uses [AIM](https://aim.microchipgnu.pt) to run Markdown-based workflows.

## Workflows

The juice is is [content folder](/public/content). You can read all the workflows created and even edit and run on your own project.

## AIM

AIM is another project I'm building, [see more here](https://aim.microchipgnu.pt)
